    in the drawing of characters. That afternoon, after writing a letter to his
    agent and discussing with the manager of his estate a matter of joint ownership,
    he returned to the book in the tranquility of his study which looked upon the park
    with its oaks.

    the names and images of the protagonists; the illusion took hold of him almost
    at once. He tasted the almost perverse pleasure of disengaging himself line by line
    from all that surrounded him, and feeling at the same time that his head was relaxing
    comfortably against the green velvet of the armchair with its high back, that the
    cigarettes were still within reach of his hand, that beyond the great windows the afternoon
    air danced under the oak trees in the park. Word by word, immersed in the

    in the mountain cabin. The woman arrived first, apprehensive; now the lover came in,

    to repeat the ceremonies of a secret passion, protected by a world of dry leaves and furtive
    paths through the forest. The dagger warmed itself against his chest, and underneath pounded
    libery, ready to spring. A lustful, yearning dialogue raced down the pages like a rivulet of
    snakes, and one felt it had all been decided from eternity. Even those caresses which writhed about the
    lover's body, as though wishing to keep him there, to dissuade him from it, sketched abominably the figure
    of that other body it was necessary to destroy. Nothing had been forgotten: alibis, unforseen hazards, possible
    mistakes. From this hour on, each instant had its use minutely assigned. The cold-blooded, double re-examination of
    the details was barely interrupted for a hand to caress a cheek. It was beginning to get dark.

      Without looking at each other now, rigidly fixed upon the task which awaited them,
      they separated at the cabin door. She was to follow the trail that led north. On the path
      leading in the opposite direction, he turned for a moment to watch her running with her hair
      let loose. He ran in turn, crouching among the trees and hedges until he could distinguish in the
      yellowish fog of dusk the avenue of trees leading up to the house. The dogs were not supposed to bark, and
      they did not bark. The estate manager would not be there at this hour, and he was not. He went up the three
      porch steps and entered. Through the blood galloping in his ears came the woman's words: first a blue parlor, then
      a gallery, then a carpeted stairway. At the top, two doors. No one in the first bedroom, no one in the second.
      The door of the salon, and then the knife in his hand, the light from the great windows, the high back of an armchair
      covered in green velvet, the head of the man in the chair reading a novel.
