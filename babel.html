    </div>
    <div class="prose">The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite
    and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded
    by very low railings. From any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper and lower
    floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves
    per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor
    to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a normal librarian. One of the free sides leads to a
    narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the
    rest. To the left and right of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the
    first, one may sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy one’s fecal necessities. Also
    through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to
    remote distances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates
    all appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not
    infinite (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that
    its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite . . . Light is provided
    by some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. There are two,
    transversally placed, in each hexagon. The light they emit is insufficient,

      Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book,
      perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am
      preparing to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will
      be no lack of pious hands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body
      will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall, which is infinite. I say
      that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute
      space or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable.
      (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose
      spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their words,
      obscure. This cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic

    <div class="prose">There are five shelves for each of the hexagon’s walls; each shelf contains
    thirty-two books of uniform format; each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page,
    of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color. There are also
    letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages
    will say. I know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the
    solution (whose discovery, in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact
    in history) I wish to recall a few axioms.

    </div>
    </div>;
    the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical volumes, of
    inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated librarian,
    can only be the work of a god. To perceive the distance between the divine and the human,
    it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of
    a book, with the organic letters inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Second: The orthographical symbols are twenty-five in number. This finding made it possible,
      three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library and solve
      satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered: the formless and chaotic
      nature of almost all the books. One which my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen
      ninety-four was made up of the letters MCV, perversely repeated from the first line to
      the last. Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but
      the next-to-last page says Oh time thy pyramids. This much is already known: for every
      sensible line of straightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies,
      verbal jumbles and incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate
      the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that
      of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one’s palm . . . They admit
      that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain
      that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves.
      This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      For a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or
      remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, used a
      language quite different from the one we now speak; it is true that a few miles to the
      right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther up, it is incomprehensible.
      All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable MCV’s cannot
      correspond to any language, no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it may be. Some
      insinuated that each letter could influence the following one and that the value of MCV
      in the third line of page 71 was not the one the same series may have in another position
      on another page, but this vague thesis did not prevail. Others thought of

        <span class="word">cryptographs</span>

         </ul>
      </div>
      </div>;
      generally, this conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was
      formulated by its originators.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon came upon a book as confusing
      as the others, but which had nearly two pages of homogeneous lines. He showed his find
      to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; others said
      they were Yiddish. Within a century, the language was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian
      dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections. The content was also deciphered:
      some notions of combinative analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited
      repetition. These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the
      fundamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how
      diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma,
      the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which travelers have
      confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical books. From these two
      incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves
      register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols
      (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite): Everything: the minutely
      detailed history of the future, the archangels’ autobiographies, the faithful catalogues
      of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those
      catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides,
      the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your
      death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books,
      the treatise that Bede could have written (and did not) about the mythology of the Saxons, the lost works of Tacitus.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first impression was one
      of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret
      treasure. There was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solution did not exist in
      some hexagon. The universe was justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited
      dimensions of hope. At that time a great deal was said about the Vindications: books of
      apology and prophecy which vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe
      and retained prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned their sweet
      native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain intention of finding their
      Vindication. These pilgrims disputed in the narrow corridors, proferred dark curses,
      strangled each other on the divine stairways, flung the deceptive books into the air shafts,
      met their death cast down in a similar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others
      went mad . . . The Vindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the
      future, to persons who are perhaps not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember
      that the possibility of a man’s finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation
      thereof, can be computed as zero.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
    At that time it was also hoped that a clarification of humanity’s basic mysteries—the origin
    of the Library and of time—might be found. It is <div class="definable">
      <span class="word">verisimilar</span>
    <div class="definition-container">
       <h4>verisimilar</h4>
       <span class="information">adjective | ver·i·si·mi·lar</span>
       <ul class="definitions">
         <li>having the appearance of truth; likely; probable</li>
       </ul>
    </div>
    </div>that these grave mysteries could
    be explained in words: if the language of philosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Library
    will have produced the unprecedented language required, with its vocabularies and grammars.
    For four centuries now men have exhausted the hexagons . . . There are official searchers,
    inquisitors. I have seen them in the performance of their function: they always arrive
    extremely tired from their journeys; they speak of a broken stairway which almost killed
    them; they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes they pick up the
    nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words. Obviously, no one expects
    to discover anything.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      As was natural, this inordinate hope was followed by an excessive depression. The
      certitude that some shelf in some hexagon held precious books and that these precious
      books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. A blasphemous sect suggested that
      the searches should cease and that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they
      constructed, by an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books. The authorities were
      obliged to issue severe orders. The sect disappeared, but in my childhood I have seen
      old men who, for long periods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks
      in a forbidden dice cup and feebly mimic the divine disorder.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Others, inversely, believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless works. They invaded
      the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always false, leafed through a volume with
      displeasure and condemned whole shelves: their hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless
      perdition of millions of books. Their name is execrated, but those who deplore the
      “treasures” destroyed by this frenzy neglect two notable facts. One: the Library is so
      enormous that any reduction of human origin is infinitesimal. The other: every copy is
      unique, irreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there are always several hundred
      thousand imperfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a letter or a comma. Counter to
      general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of the Purifiers’ depredations
      have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics produced. They were urged on by the
      delirium of trying to reach the books in the Crimson Hexagon: books whose format is smaller
      than usual, all-powerful, illustrated and magical.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      We also know of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf
      in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book which is the formula and perfect
      compendium of all the rest: some librarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a
      god. In the language of this zone vestiges of this remote functionary’s cult still
      persist. Many wandered in search of Him. For a century they have exhausted in vain the
      most varied areas. How could one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Him?
      Someone proposed a regressive method: To locate book A, consult first book B which indicates
      A’s position; to locate book B, consult first a book C, and so on to infinity . . .
      In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years. It does not seem
      unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the universe;
      I pray to the unknown gods that a man—just one, even though it were thousands of years ago!
      —may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me, let them
      be for others. Let heaven exist, though my place be in hell. Let me be outraged and
      annihilated, but for one instant, in one being, let Your enormous Library be justified. The

         </ul>
      </div>
      </div>maintain that nonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and even humble
      and pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. They speak (I know) of the “feverish Library
      whose chance volumes are constantly in danger of changing into others and affirm, negate and confuse
      everything like a delirious divinity.” These words, which not only denounce the disorder but exemplify
      it as well, notoriously prove their authors’ abominable taste and desperate ignorance.
      In truth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted by the
      twenty-five orthographical symbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense. It is
      useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons under my administration is
      entitled The Combed Thunderclap and another The Plaster Cramp and another Axaxaxas mlö.
      These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical
      or allegorical manner; such a justification is verbal and,

      contain a terrible meaning. No one can articulate a syllable which is not filled with
      tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these languages, the powerful name of a god.

        </div>
      </div>. This wordy and useless epistle already exists in one
      of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of one of the innumerable hexagons—and its
      refutation as well. (An <em>n</em> number of possible languages use the same vocabulary; in some of
      them, the symbol library allows the correct definition ubiquitous and lasting system of
      hexagonal galleries, but library is bread or pyramid or anything else, and these seven
      words which define it have another value. You who read me, are You sure of understanding
      my language?)
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      The methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men. The certitude
      that everything has been written negates us or turns us into phantoms. I know of districts
     in which the young men prostrate themselves before books and kiss their pages in a barbarous
      manner, but they do not know how to decipher a single letter. Epidemics, heretical conflicts,
      peregrinations which inevitably degenerate into banditry, have decimated the population. I believe
      I have mentioned suicides, more and more frequent with the years. Perhaps my old age and fearfulness
      deceive me, but I suspect that the human species—the unique species—is about to be extinguished, but
      the Library will endure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, equipped with precious
      volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      I have just written the word “infinite.” I have not interpolated this adjective out of
     rhetorical habit; I say that it is not illogical to think that the world is infinite. Those
      who judge it to be limited postulate that in remote places the corridors and stairways and
      hexagons can, inconceivably, come to an end—which is absurd. Those who imagine it to be
      without limit forget that the possible number of books does have such a limit. I venture
      to suggest this solution to the ancient problem: The Library is unlimited and cyclical.
      If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries he would see that
      the same volumes were repeated in the same disorder (which, thus repeated, would be an
      order: the Order). My solitude is gladdened by this elegant hope.
