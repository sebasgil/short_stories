      <span class="name">THE LAST QUESTION</span>
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      The last question was asked for the first time, half in jest, on May 21, 2061,
      at a time when humanity first stepped into the light. The question came about as
       a result of a five dollar bet over highballs, and it happened this way:
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Alexander Adell and Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of Multivac.
      As well as any human beings could, they knew what lay behind the cold, clicking,
      flashing face — miles and miles of face — of that giant computer. They had at least
      a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown
      past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Multivac was self-adjusting and self-correcting. It had to be, for nothing human could
      adjust and correct it quickly enough or even adequately enough — so Adell and Lupov attended
      the monstrous giant only lightly and superficially, yet as well as any men could. They fed it
      data, adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued. Certainly they,
      and all others like them, were fully entitled to share in the glory that was Multivac's.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      For decades, Multivac had helped design the ships and plot the trajectories that enabled man to
      reach the Moon, Mars, and Venus, but past that, Earth's poor resources could not support the ships.
      Too much energy was needed for the long trips. Earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing
      efficiency, but there was only so much of both.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      But slowly Multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, and on May 14,
      2061, what had been theory, became fact.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      The energy of the sun was stored, converted, and utilized directly on a planet-wide scale. All Earth
      turned off its burning coal, its fissioning uranium, and flipped the switch that connected all of it to
      a small station, one mile in diameter, circling the Earth at half the distance of the Moon. All Earth ran
      by invisible beams of sunpower.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and Adell and Lupov finally managed to escape
      from the public function, and to meet in quiet where no one would think of looking for them, in the
      deserted underground chambers, where portions of the mighty buried body of Multivac showed. Unattended,

      appreciated that. They had no intention, originally, of disturbing it.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      They had brought a bottle with them, and their only concern at the moment was to relax
      in the company of each other and the bottle.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;It's amazing when you think of it," said Adell. His broad face had lines of
      weariness in it, and he stirred his drink slowly with a glass rod, watching
      the cubes of ice

       Enough energy, if we wanted to draw on it, to melt all Earth into a big drop
       of impure liquid iron, and still never miss the energy so used. All the energy
       we could ever use, forever and forever and forever."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Lupov cocked his head sideways. He had a trick of doing that when he wanted
      to be contrary, and he wanted to be contrary now, partly because he had had
      to carry the ice and glassware. &ldquo;Not forever," he said.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Oh, hell, just about forever. Till the sun runs down, Bert."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;That's not forever."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;All right, then. Billions and billions of years. Twenty billion, maybe.
      Are you satisfied?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Lupov put his fingers through his thinning hair as though to reassure himself
      that some was still left and sipped gently at his own drink. &ldquo;Twenty billion
      years isn't forever."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Well, it will last our time, won't it?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;So would the coal and uranium."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;All right, but now we can hook up each individual spaceship to the Solar
      Station, and it can go to Pluto and back a million times without ever
      worrying about fuel. You can't do THAT on coal and uranium. Ask Multivac,
      if you don't believe me."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I don't have to ask Multivac. I know that."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Then stop running down what Multivac's done for us," said Adell, blazing up.
       &ldquo;It did all right."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Who says it didn't? What I say is that a sun won't last forever. That's all
       I'm saying. We're safe for twenty billion years, but then what?" Lupov
       pointed a slightly shaky finger at the other. &ldquo;And don't say we'll switch to another sun."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      There was silence for a while. Adell put his glass to his lips only occasionally,
      and Lupov's eyes slowly closed. They rested.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Then Lupov's eyes snapped open. &ldquo;You're thinking we'll switch to another sun when
      ours is done, aren't you?"
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I'm not thinking."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Sure you are. You're weak on

      a grove of trees and got under one. He wasn't worried, you see, because he
      figured when one tree got wet through, he would just get under another one."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I get it," said Adell. &ldquo;Don't shout. When the sun is done, the other stars
      will be gone, too."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Darn right they will," muttered Lupov. &ldquo;It all had a beginning in the
      original cosmic explosion, whatever that was, and it'll all have an end
      when all the stars run down. Some run down faster than others. Hell, the
      giants won't last a hundred million years. The sun will last twenty billion
      years and maybe the dwarfs will last a hundred billion for all the good they
      are. But just give us a trillion years and everything will be dark.

    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I know all about entropy," said Adell, standing on his dignity.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;The hell you do."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I know as much as you do."

    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;All right. Who says they won't?"
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;You did, you poor sap. You said we had all the energy we needed, forever.
       You said 'forever.'"
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;It was Adell's turn to be contrary. "Maybe we can build things up again
      someday," he said.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Never."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Why not? Someday."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Never."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Ask Multivac."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;<em>You</em> ask Multivac. I dare you. Five dollars says it can't be done."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Adell was just drunk enough to try, just sober enough to be able to phrase
      the necessary symbols and operations into a question which, in words, might
      have corresponded to this: Will mankind one day without the net expenditure
      of energy be able to restore the sun to its full youthfulness even after it
      had died of old age?
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Or maybe it could be put more simply like this: How can the net amount of
      entropy of the universe be massively decreased?
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Multivac fell dead and silent. The slow flashing of lights ceased, the
      distant sounds of clicking relays ended.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Then, just as the frightened technicians felt they could hold their breath
      no longer, there was a sudden springing to life of the teletype attached to
      that portion of Multivac. Five words were printed: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;No bet," whispered Lupov. They left hurriedly.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      By next morning, the two, plagued with throbbing head and cottony mouth, had
      forgotten about the incident.
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="prose">
      Jerrodd, Jerrodine, and Jerrodette I and II watched the starry picture in the
      visiplate change as the passage through
      <div class="definable">
        <span class="word">hyperspace</span><!-- Trailing comments prevents indentation whitespace from displaying between divs.
       --><div class="definition-container">

          </ul>
        </div><!--
      --></div> was completed in its non-time
      lapse. At once, the even powdering of stars gave way to the predominance of a
      single bright marble-disk, centered.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;That's X-23," said Jerrodd confidently. His thin hands clamped tightly behind
      his back and the knuckles whitened.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      The little Jerrodettes, both girls, had experienced the hyperspace passage
      for the first time in their lives and were self-conscious over the momentary
      sensation of inside-outness. They buried their giggles and chased one another
      wildly about their mother, screaming, "We've reached X-23 — we've reached X-23 — we've ——"
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Quiet, children," said Jerrodine sharply. "Are you sure, Jerrodd?"
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;What is there to be but sure?" asked Jerrodd, glancing up at the bulge of
      featureless metal just under the ceiling. It ran the length of the room,
      disappearing through the wall at either end. It was as long as the ship.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Jerrodd scarcely knew a thing about the thick rod of metal except that it was
      called a Microvac, that one asked it questions if one wished; that if one did
      not it still had its task of guiding the ship to a preordered destination; of
      feeding on energies from the various Sub-galactic Power Stations; of computing
      the equations for the hyperspacial jumps.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Jerrodd and his family had only to wait and live in the comfortable residence
      quarters of the ship.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Someone had once told Jerrodd that the "ac" at the end of "Microvac" stood
      for "analog computer" in ancient English, but he was on the edge of forgetting even that.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Jerrodine's eyes were moist as she watched the visiplate. "I can't help it.
      I feel funny about leaving Earth."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Why for Pete's sake?" demanded Jerrodd. &ldquo;We had nothing there. We'll have
      everything on X-23. You won't be alone. You won't be a pioneer. There are
      over a million people on the planet already. Good Lord, our great grandchildren
      will be looking for new worlds because X-23 will be overcrowded."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Then, after a reflective pause, &ldquo;I tell you, it's a lucky thing the computers
      worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I know, I know," said Jerrodine miserably.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Jerrodette I said promptly, &ldquo;Our Microvac is the best Microvac in the world."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I think so, too," said Jerrodd, tousling her hair.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      It was a nice feeling to have a Microvac of your own and Jerrodd was glad
      he was part of his generation and no other. In his father's youth, the only
      computers had been tremendous machines taking up a hundred square miles of
      land. There was only one to a planet. Planetary ACs they were called. They
      had been growing in size steadily for a thousand years and then, all at once,
      came refinement. In place of transistors had come molecular valves so that
      even the largest Planetary AC could be put into a space only half the volume of a spaceship.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Jerrodd felt uplifted, as he always did when he thought that his own personal
      Microvac was many times more complicated than the ancient and primitive Multivac
      that had first tamed the Sun, and almost as complicated as Earth's Planetary AC
      (the largest) that had first solved the problem of hyperspatial travel and had
      made trips to the stars possible.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;So many stars, so many planets," sighed Jerrodine, busy with her own thoughts.
      &ldquo;I suppose families will be going out to new planets forever, the way we are now."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Not forever," said Jerrodd, with a smile. &ldquo;It will all stop someday, but not
      for billions of years. Many billions. Even the stars run down, you know. Entropy must increase."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;What's entropy, daddy?" shrilled Jerrodette II.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Entropy, little sweet, is just a word which means the amount of running-down
      of the universe. Everything runs down, you know, like your little walkie-talkie robot, remember?"
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Can't you just put in a new power-unit, like with my robot?"
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      The stars are the power-units, dear. Once they're gone, there are no more power-units."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Jerrodette I at once set up a howl. &ldquo;Don't let them, daddy. Don't let the stars run down."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Now look what you've done," whispered Jerrodine, exasperated.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;How was I to know it would frighten them?" Jerrodd whispered back.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Ask the Microvac," wailed Jerrodette I. &ldquo;Ask him how to turn the stars on again."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Go ahead," said Jerrodine. &ldquo;It will quiet them down." (Jerrodette II was beginning to cry, also.)
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Jarrodd shrugged. &ldquo;Now, now, honeys. I'll ask Microvac. Don't worry, he'll tell us."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      He asked the Microvac, adding quickly, &ldquo;Print the answer."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Jerrodd cupped the strip of thin cellufilm and said cheerfully, &ldquo;See now,
      the Microvac says it will take care of everything when the time comes so don't worry."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Jerrodine said, &ldquo;and now children, it's time for bed. We'll be in our new home soon."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Jerrodd read the words on the cellufilm again before destroying it: INSUFFICIENT
      DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      He shrugged and looked at the visiplate. X-23 was just ahead.
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="prose">
      VJ-23X of Lameth stared into the black depths of the three-dimensional, small-scale
      map of the Galaxy and said, &ldquo;Are we ridiculous, I wonder, in being so concerned about the matter?"
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      MQ-17J of Nicron shook his head. &ldquo;I think not. You know the Galaxy will be filled
      in five years at the present rate of expansion."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Both seemed in their early twenties, both were tall and perfectly formed.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Still," said VJ-23X, &ldquo;I hesitate to submit a pessimistic report to the Galactic Council."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I wouldn't consider any other kind of report. Stir them up a bit. We've got to stir them up."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      VJ-23X sighed. &ldquo;Space is infinite. A hundred billion Galaxies are there for the taking. More."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;A hundred billion is not infinite and it's getting less infinite all the time.
      Consider! Twenty thousand years ago, mankind first solved the problem of utilizing
      stellar energy, and a few centuries later, interstellar travel became possible. It
      took mankind a million years to fill one small world and then only fifteen thousand
       years to fill the rest of the Galaxy. Now the population doubles every ten years —"
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      VJ-23X interrupted. &ldquo;We can thank immortality for that."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Very well. Immortality exists and we have to take it into account. I admit it has
      its seamy side, this immortality. The Galactic AC has solved many problems for us,
      but in solving the problems of preventing old age and death, it has undone all its other solutions."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Yet you wouldn't want to abandon life, I suppose."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Not at all," snapped MQ-17J, softening it at once to, &ldquo;Not yet. I'm by no
       means old enough. How old are you?"
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Two hundred twenty-three. And you?"
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I'm still under two hundred. —But to get back to my point. Population doubles
      every ten years. Once this Galaxy is filled, we'll have another filled in ten years.

      that was almost a dead weight. More and more, the real essence of men was to
      be found out here, in space.

    <div class="prose">
      Zee Prime was roused out of his reverie upon coming across the wispy tendrils of another mind.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I am Zee Prime," said Zee Prime. &ldquo;And you?"

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I am Dee Sub Wun. Your Galaxy?"

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;We call ours the same. All men call their Galaxy their Galaxy and nothing more. Why not?"
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;True. Since all Galaxies are the same."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Not all Galaxies. On one particular Galaxy the race of man must have originated. That makes it different."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Zee Prime said, &ldquo;On which one?"
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I cannot say. The Universal AC would know."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Shall we ask him? I am suddenly curious."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Zee Prime's perceptions broadened until the Galaxies themselves shrunk and
      became a new, more diffuse powdering on a much larger background. So many hundreds
      of billions of them, all with their immortal beings, all carrying their load of
      intelligences with minds that drifted freely through space. And yet one of them
      was unique among them all in being the originals Galaxy. One of them had, in its
      vague and distant past, a period when it was the only Galaxy populated by man.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Zee Prime was consumed with curiosity to see this Galaxy and called, out:
      &ldquo;Universal AC! On which Galaxy did mankind originate?"
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      The Universal AC heard, for on every world and throughout space, it had its
      receptors ready, and each receptor lead through hyperspace to some unknown point
      where the Universal AC kept itself aloof.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Zee Prime knew of only one man whose thoughts had penetrated within sensing
      distance of Universal AC, and he reported only a shining globe, two feet across,
      difficult to see.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;But how can that be all of Universal AC?" Zee Prime had asked.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Most of it," had been the answer, &ldquo;is in hyperspace. In what form it is
      there I cannot imagine."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Nor could anyone, for the day had long since passed, Zee Prime knew, when any
      man had any part of the making of a universal AC. Each Universal AC designed
      and constructed its successor. Each, during its existence of a million years
      or more accumulated the necessary data to build a better and more intricate, more
      capable successor in which its own store of data and individuality would be submerged.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      The Universal AC interrupted Zee Prime's wandering thoughts, not with words, but
      with guidance. Zee Prime's mentality was guided into the dim sea of Galaxies and
      one in particular enlarged into stars.
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      A thought came, infinitely distant, but infinitely clear. &ldquo;THIS IS THE ORIGINAL
      GALAXY OF MAN."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      But it was the same after all, the same as any other, and Zee Prime stifled
      his disappointment.

    <div class="prose">
      Dee Sub Wun, whose mind had accompanied the other, said suddenly, &ldquo;And is one
      of these stars the original star of Man?"

    <div class="prose">
      The Universal AC said, &ldquo;A NEW WORLD, AS IN SUCH CASES, WAS CONSTRUCTED FOR
      THEIR PHYSICAL BODIES IN TIME."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Yes, of course," said Zee Prime, but a sense of loss overwhelmed him even so.
      His mind released its hold on the original Galaxy of Man, let it spring back
      and lose itself among the blurred pin points. He never wanted to see it again.

      &ldquo;But when all energy is gone, our bodies will finally die, and you and I with them."

    <div class="prose">

    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Dee sub Wun said in amusement, &ldquo;You're asking how entropy might be reversed in direction."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      And the Universal AC answered. &ldquo;THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER."
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      Zee Prime's thoughts fled back to his own Galaxy. He gave no further thought
      to Dee Sub Wun, whose body might be waiting on a galaxy a trillion light-years
      away, or on the star next to Zee Prime's own. It didn't matter.

    <div class="prose">
      Unhappily, Zee Prime began collecting interstellar hydrogen out of which to
