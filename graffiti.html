    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      At four-fifteen in the afternoon, T.S.T., Garson Poole woke up in his
      hospital bed, knew that he lay in a hospital bed in a three-bed ward and
      realized in addition two things: that he no longer had a right hand and that
      he felt no pain.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      They had given me a strong analgesic, he said to himself as he stared at the
      far wall with its window showing downtown New York. Webs in which vehicles
      and peds darted and wheeled glimmered in the late afternoon sun, and the
      brilliance of the aging light pleased him. It's not yet out, he thought.
      And neither am I
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      A fone lay on the table beside his bed; he hesitated, then picked it up
      and dialed for an outside line. A moment later he was faced by Louis Danceman,
      in charge of Tri-Plan's activities while he, Garson Poole, was elsewhere.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Thank God you're alive," Danceman said, seeing him; his big, fleshy
      face with its moon's surface of pack marks flattened with relief.
      &ldquo;I've been calling all—"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I  just don't have a right hand," Poole said.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;But you'll be okay. I mean, they can graft another one on."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;How long have I been here?" Poole said. He wondered where the nurses and
      doctors had gone to; why weren't they clucking and fussing about him making
      a call?
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Four days," Danceman said. &ldquo;Everything here at the plant is going spunkishly
      In fact we've

      --></div> orders from three separate police systems, all here on Terra. Two
      in Ohio, one in Wyoming. Good solid orders, with one third in advance and the
      usual three-year lease-option."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Come get me out of here," Poole said.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I can't get you out until the new hand —"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I'll have it done later." He wanted desperately to get back to familiar
      surroundings; memory of the mercantile

      --></div> looming grotesquely on the pilot screen careened at the back of
      his mind; if he shut his eyes he felt himself back in his damaged craft as
      it plunged from one vehicle to another, piling up enormouse damage as it went.
      The kinetic sensations...he wince, recalling them. I guess I'm lucky, he
      said to himself.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Is Sarah Benton with you?" Danceman asked.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;No." Of course; his personal secretary — if only for job considerations —
      would be hovering close by, mothering him in her

      And they're dangerous, if they fall on you they can kill you. &ldquo;Maybe that's
      what happened to me," he said aloud. &ldquo;Maybe Sarah fell on my squib."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;No, no; a tie rod in the steering fin of your squib split apart during the
        heavy rush-hour traffic and you —"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I remember." He turned in his bed as the door of the ward opened; a white-clad
      doctor and two blue-clad nurses appeared, making their way toward his bed. &ldquo;I'll
      talk to you later," Poole said and hung up the fone. He took a deep, expectant
      breath.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;You shouldn't be foning quite so soon," the doctor said as he studied his chart.
      &ldquo;Mr. Garson Poole, owner of Tri-Plan Electronics. Maker of random ident darts
      that track their prey for a circle-radius of a thousand miles, responding to
      unique enceph wave patterns. You're a successful man, Mr. Poole. But, Mr. Poole,
      you're not a man. You're an electric ant."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Christ," Poole said, stunned.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;So we can't really treat you here, now that we've found out. We knew, of course,
      as soon as we examined your injured right hand; we saw the electronic components
      and then we made torso x-rays and of course they bore out our

    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      A nurse said, &ldquo;An organic robot."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I see," Poole said. Frigid perspiration rose to the surface of his skin, across
      all his body.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;You didn't know," the doctor said.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;No." Poole shook his head.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      The doctor said, &ldquo;We get an electric ant every week or so. Either brought in
      here from a squib accident — like yourself — or one seeking voluntary admission ...
      one who, like yourself, has never been told, who has functioned alongside humans,
      believing himself —itself—human. As to your hand —" He paused.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Forget my hand," Poole said savagely.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Be calm." The doctor leaned over him, peered acutely down into Poole's face.
      &ldquo;We'll have a hospital boat convey you over to a service facility where repairs,
      or replacement, on your hand can be made at a reasonable expense, either to yourself,
      if you're self-owned, or to your owners, if such they are. In any case you'll be
      back at your desk at Tri-Plan functioning just as before."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Except," Poole said, &ldquo;now I know." He wondered if Danceman or Sarah or any of
      the others at the office knew. Had they — or one of them — purchased him? Designed him?
      A figurehead, he said to himself; that's all I've been. I must never really have run
      the company; it was a delusion implanted in me when I was made ... along with the dilusion
      that I am human and alive.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Before you leave for the repair facility," the doctor said, &ldquo;could you kindly
      settle your bill at the front desk?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Poole said acidly, &ldquo;How can there be a bill if you don't treat ants here?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;For our services," the nurse said. &ldquo;Up until the point we knew."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Bill me," Poolse said, with furious, impotent anger. &ldquo;Bill my firm." With
      massive effort he managed to sit up; his head swimming, he stepped haltingly
      from the bed and onto the floor. &ldquo;I'll be glad to leave here," he said as he
      rose to a standing position. &ldquo;And thank you for your humane attention."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Thank you, too, Mr. Poole," the doctor said. &ldquo;Or rather I should just say
      Poole."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      At the repair facility he had his missing hand replaced.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      It proved fascinating, the hand; he examined it for a long time before he let
      the technicians install it. On the surface it appeared organic — in fact on the
      surface, it was. Natural skin covered natural flesh, and true blood filled the
      veins and capillaries. But beneath that, wires and circuits, miniaturized components,
      gleamed... looking deep into the wrist he sas surge gates, motors, multi-stage valves,
      all very small. Intricate. And — the hand cost forty frogs. A week's salary, insofar
      as he knew from his company payroll.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Is this guaranteed?" he asked the technicians as they fused the &ldquo;bone" section
      of the hand to the balance of his body.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Ninety days, parts and labor," one of the technicians said. &ldquo;Unless subjected to
      unusual or intentional abuse."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;That sounds vaguely suggestive," Poole said.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      The technician, a man —all of them were men—said, regarding him keenly, &ldquo;You've
      been posing?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Unintentionally," Poole said.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;And now it's intentional?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Poole said, &ldquo;Exactly."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Do you know why you never guessed? There must have been signs... clickings and
      whirrings from inside you, now and then. You never guessed because you were
      programmed not to notice. You'll now have the same difficulty finding out why you
      were built and for whom you've been operating."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;A slave," Poole said. &ldquo;A mechanical slave."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;You've had fun."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I've lived a good life," Poole said. &ldquo;I've worked hard."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      He paid the facility its forty frogs, flexed new fingers, tested them out by
      picking up various objects such as coins, then departed. Ten minutes later he
      was aboard a public carrier, on his way home. It had been quite a day.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      At home, in his one-room apartment, he poured himself a shot of Jack Daniel's
      Purple Label — a sixty years old — and sat sipping it, meanwhile gazing through
      his sole window at the building on the opposite side of the street. Shall I go
      to the office? he asked himself. If so, why? If not, why? Choose one. Christ,
      he thought, it undermines you, knowing this. I'm a freak, he realized. An inanimate
      object mimicking an animate one. But — he felt alive. Yet ... he felt differently,
      now. About himself. Hence about everyone, especially Danceman and Sarah, everyone
      at Tri-Plan.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      I think I'll kill myself, he said to himself. But I'm probably programmed not
      to do that; it would be a costly waste which my owner would have to absorb.
      And he wouldn't want to.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Programmed. In me somewhere, he thought, there is a matrix fitted in place,
      a grid that cuts me off from certain thoughts, certain actions. And forces
      me into others. I am not free. I never was, but now I know it; that makes it
      different.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Turning his window to opaque, he snapped on the overhead light, carefully
      set about removing his clothing, piece by piece. He had watched carefully
      as the technicians at the repair facility had attached his new hand: he had
      a rather clear idea, now, of how his body had been assembled. Two major panels,
      one in each thigh; the technicians had removed the panels to check the circuit
      complexes beneath. If I'm programmed, he decided, the matrix can be found there.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      The maze of circuitry baffled him. I need help, he said to himself. Let's see ...
      what's the fone code for the class BBB compute we hire at the office?
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      He picked up the fone, dialed the computer at its permanent location in Boise,
      Idaho.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Use of this computer is
      <div class="definable">

        </div><!--
      --></div> at a rate of five frogs per minute," a mechanical voice from the
      fone said. &ldquo;Please hold your mastercreditchargeplate before the screen."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      He did so.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;At the sound of the buzzer you will be connected with the computer," the voice
      continued. &ldquo;Please query it as rapidly as possible, taking into account that its
      answer will be given in terms of a microsecond, while your query will—" He turned
      the sound, then. But quickly turned it up as the blank audio input of the screen
      appeared on the screen. At this moment the computer had become a giant ear, listening
      to him — as well as fifty thousand other querirers throughout Terra.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Scan me visually," he instructed the computer. &ldquo;And tell me where I will find
      the programming mechanism which controls my thoughts and behavior." He waited.
      On the fone's screen a great active eye, multi-lensed, peered at him; he displayed
      himself for it, there in his one-room apartment.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      The computer said, &ldquo;Remove your chest panel. Apply pressure at your breastbone
      and then ease outward."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      He did so. A section of his chest came off; dizzily, he set it down on the floor.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I can distinguish control modules," the computer said, &ldquo;but I can't tell which —"
      It paused as its eye roved about on the fone screen. &ldquo;I distinguish a roll of punched
      tape mounted above your heart mechanis. Do you see it?" Poole craned his neck, peered.
      He saw it, too. &ldquo;I will have to sign off," the computer said. &ldquo;After I have examined
      the data available to me I will contact you and give you an answer. Good day." The screen
      died out.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      I'll yank the tape out of me, Poole said to himself. Tiny ... no larger than
      two spools of thread, with a scanner mounted between the delivery drum and the take-up
      drum. He could not see any sign of motion; the spools seemed inert. The must cut in as
      override, he reflected, when specific situations occur. Override to my

      --></div> process. And they've been doing it all my lie.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      He reached down, touched the delivery drum. All I have to do is tear this out,
      he thought, and —
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      The fone screen relit. &ldquo;Mastercreditchargeplate number 3-BNX-882-HQR446-T,"
      the computer's voice came. &ldquo;This is BBB-307DR recontacting you in response to
      your query of sixteen seconds lapse, November 4, 1992. The punched tape roll
      above your heart mechanism is not a programming turret but is in fact a reality-
      supply construct. All sense stimuli received by your central neurological system
      emanate from that unit and tampering with it would be risky if not terminal."
      It added, &ldquo;You appear to have no programming circuit. Query answered. Good day."
      It flicked off.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Poole, standing naked before the fone screen, touched the tape drum once agian,
      with calculated, enormous caution. I see, he thought wildly. Or do I see?
      This unit—
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      If I cut te tape, he realized, my world will disappear. Reality will continue
      for others, but not for me. Because my reality, my universe, is coming to me
      from this miniscule unit. Fed into the scanner and then into my central nervous
      system as it snailishly unwinds.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      It has been unwinding for years, he decided.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Getting his clothes, he redressed, seated himself in his big armchar — a luxury
      imported into his apartment from Tri-Plan's main offices — and lit a tobacco
      cigarette. His hands shook as he laid down his initialed lighter; leaning back,
      he blew smoke before himself, creating a nimbus of gray.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      I have to go slowly, he said to himself. What am I trying to do? Bypass my
      programming? But the computer found no programming circuit. Do I want to
      interfere with my reality tape? And if so, <em>why</em>?
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Because, he thought, if I control that, I control reality. At least so far as
      I'm concerned. My subjective reality... but that's all there is. Objective reality
      is a synthetic construct, dealing with a hypothetical universalization of a multitude
      of subjective realities.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      My universe is lying within my fingers, he realized. If I can just figure out how
      the damn thing works. All I set out to do originally was to search for and locate
      my programming circuit so I could gain true

    <div class="prose">
      With this he did not merely gain control of himself; he gained control
      over everything.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      And this sets me apart from every human who ever lived and died, he thought
      somberly.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Going over to the fone he dialed his office. When he had Danceman on the screen
      he said briskly, &ldquo;I want you to send a complete set of microtools and enlarging
      screen over to my apartment. I have some microcircuitry to work on." Then he
      broke the connection not wanting to discuss it.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      A half hour later a knock sounded on his door. When he opened up he found
      himself facing one of the shop foremen, loaded down with microtools of every sort.
      &ldquo;You didn't say exactly what you wanted," the foreman said, entering the apartment.
      &ldquo;So Mr. Danceman had me bring everything."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;And the enlarging-lens system?"

      Maybe what I want to do, Poole thought, is die. He lit a cigarette, stood
      smoking and waiting as the shop foreman lugged the heavy enlarging screen,
      with its power-supply and control panel, into the apartment. This is suicide,
      what I'm doing here. He shuddered.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Anything wrong, Mr. Poole?" the shop foreman said as he rose to his feet, relieved
      of the burden of the enlarging-lens system. &ldquo;You must still be rickety on your pins
      from your accident."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Yes," Poole said quietly. He stood tautly waiting until the foreman left.
      Under the enlarging-lens system the plastic tape assumed a new shape: a wide track
      along which hundreds of thousands of punch-holes worked their way. I thought so,
      Poole thought. Not recorded as charges on a ferrous oxide layer but actually
      punched-free slots.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Under the lense the strip of tape visibly oozed forward. Very slowly, but it did,
      at uniform velocity, move in the direction of the scanner.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      The way I figure it, he thought, is that the punched holes are <em>on</em> gates.
      It functions like a player piano; solid is no, punch-hole is yes. How can I test this?
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Obviously by filling in a number of holes.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      He measured the amount of tape left on the delivery spool, calculated — at great
      effort — the velocity of the tape's movement, and then came up with a figure.
      If he altered the tape visible at in-going edge of the scanner, five to seven hours
      would pass before that particular time period arrived. He would in effect be painting
      out stimuli due a few hours from now.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      With a microbrush he swabbed a large — relatively large — section of tape
      with opaque varnish ... obtained from the supply kit accompanying the microtools.
      I have smeared out stimuli for about half an hour, he pondered. Have covered
      at least a thousand punches.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      It would be interesting to see what change, if any, overcame his environment,
      six hours from now.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Five and a half hours later he sat at Krackter's, a superb bar in Manhattan,
      having a drink with Danceman.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;You look bad," Danceman said.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I am bad," Poole said. He finished his drink, a Scotch sour, and ordered another.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;From the accident?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;In a sense, yes."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Danceman said, &ldquo;Is it — something you found out about yourself?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Rasing his head, Poole eyed him in the murky light of the bar. &ldquo;Then you know."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I know," Danceman said, &ldquo;that I should call you 'Poole' instead of 'Mr. Poole'.
      But I prefer the latter, and will continue to do so."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;How long have you known?" Poole said.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Since you took over the firm. I was told that the actual owners of Tri-Plan,
      who are located in the Prox System, wanted Tri-Plan run by an electric ant
      whom they could control. They wanted a brilliant and forceful —"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;The real owners?" This was the first he had heard about that. &ldquo;We have two
      thousand stockholders. Scattered everywhere."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Marvis Bey and her husband Ernan, on Prox 4, control fifty-one percent of the
      voting stock. This has been true from the start."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Why didn't I know?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I was told not to tell you. You were to think that you yourself made all company
      policy. With my help. But actually I was feeding you what the Beys fed to me."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I'm a figurehead," Poole said.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;In a sense, yes." Danceman nodded. &ldquo;But you'll always be 'Mr. Poole' to me."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      A section of the far wall vanished. And with it, several people at tables nearby.
      And —
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Through the big glass side of the bar, the skyline of New York City flickered
      out of existence.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Seeing his face, Danceman said, &ldquo;What is it?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Poole said hoarsely, &ldquo;Look around. Do you see any changes?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      After looking around the room, Danceman said, &ldquo;no. What like?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;You still see the skyline?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Sure. Smoggy as it is. The lights wink —"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Now I know," Poole said. He had been right; every punch-hole coveed up meant
      the disappearance of some object in his reality world. Standing, he said, &ldquo;I'll
      see you later, Danceman. I have to get back to my apartment; there's some work I'm doing.
      Goodnight." He strode from the bar and out onto the street, searching for a cab.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      No cabs.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Those, too, he thought. I wonder what else I painted over. Prostitutes? Flowers?
      Prisons?
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      There, in the bar's parking lot, Danceman's squib. I'll take that, he decided.
      There are still cabs in Danceman's world; he can get one later. Anyhow, it's a
      company car, and I hold a copy of the key.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Presently he was in the air, turning toward his apartment.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      New York City had not returned. To the left and right vehicles and buildings,
      streets, ped-runners, signs ... and in the center nothing. How can I fly into that?
      he asked himself. I'd disappear.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Or would I? He flew toward the nothingness.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Smoking one cigarette after another he flew in a circle for fifteen minutes ...
      and then, soundlessly, New York reappeared. He could finish his trip. He stubbed
      out his cigarette (a waste of something so valuable) and shot off in the direction
      of his apartment.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      If I insert a narrow opaque strip, he pondered as he unlocked his apartment door,
      I can —
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      His thoughts ceased. Someone sat in his living room chair, watching a captain kirk
      on the TV. &ldquo;Sarah," he said, <div class="definable">

    <div class="prose">
      She rose, well-padded but graceful. &ldquo;You weren't at the hospital, so I came here.
      I still have that key you gave me back in March after we had that awful argument.
      Oh... you look so depressed." She came up to him, peeped into his face anxiously.
      &ldquo;Does your injury hurt that badly?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;It's not that." He removed his coat, tie, shirt, and then his chest panel; kneeling
      down he began inserting his hands into the microtool gloves. Pausing, he looked up
      at her and said, &ldquo;I found out I'm an electric ant. Which from one standpoint
      opens up certain possibilities, which I am exploring now." He flexed his fingers and,
      at the far end of the lect waldo, a micro scewdriver moved, magnified into visibility
      by the enlarging-lens system. &ldquo;You can watch," he informed her. &ldquo;If you so desire."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      She had begun to cry.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;What's the matter?" he demanded savagely, without looking up from his work.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I — it's just so sad. You've been such a good employer to all of us at Tri-Plan.
      We respect you so. And now it's all changed."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      The plastic tape had an unpunched margin at top and bottom; he cut a horizontal
      strip, very narrow, then after a moment of great concentration, cut the tape itself
      four hours away from the scanning head. He then rotated the cut strip into a right-angle
      piece in relation to the scanner, fused it in place with a micro heat element, then
      reattached the tape reel to its left and right sides. He had, in effect, inserted a dead
      twenty minutes into the unfolding flow of his reality. It would take effect — according
      to his calculations — a few minutes after midnight.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Are you fixing yourself?" Sarah asked timidly.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Poole said, &ldquo;I'm freeing myself." Beyond this he had several alterations in mind.
      But first he had to test his theory; blank, unpunched tape meant no stimuli, in which
      case the <em>lack</em> of tape...
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;That look on your face," Sarah said. She began gathering up her purse, coat,
      rolled-up aud-vid magazine. &ldquo;I'll go; I can see how you feel about finding me here."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Stay," he said. &ldquo;I'll watch the captain kirk with you." He got into his shirt.
      &ldquo;Remember years ago when they were — what was it? — twenty or twenty-two TV channels?
      Before the government shut down the independents?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      She nodded.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;What would it have looked like," he said, &ldquo;if this TV set projected all channels
      onto the cathode ray screen <em>at the same time</em>? Could we have distinguished
      anything, in the mixture?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I don't think so."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Maybe we could learn to. Learn to be selective; do our own job of perceiving
      what we wanted to and what we didn't. Think of the possibilities, if our brains
      could handle twenty image at once; think of the amount of knowledge which could be
      stored during a given period. I wonder if the brain, the human brain—" He broke off.
      &ldquo;the human brain couldn't do it," he said, presently, reflecting to himself. "But in
      theory a quasi-organic brain might."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Is that what you have?" Sarah asked.

      &ldquo;Yes," Poole said.

      They watched the captain kirk to its end, and then they went to bed. But Poole
      sat up against his pillows, smoking and brooding. Beside him, Sarah stirred
      restlessly, wondering why he did not turn off the light.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Eleven-fifty. It would happen anytime, now.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Sarah," he said. &ldquo;I want your help. In a very few minutes something strange
      will happen to me. It won't last long, but I want you to watch me carefully.
      See if I —" He gestured. &ldquo;Show any changes. If I seem to go to sleep, or if
      I talk nonsense, or —" He wanted to say, if I disappear. But he did not. "I won't
      do you any harm, but I think it might be a good idea if you armed yourself. Do
      you have your anti-mugging gun with you?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;In my purse." She had become fully awake now; sitting up in bed, she gazed at
      him with wild fright, but her ample shoulders tanned and freckled in the light
      of the room.

    <div class="prose">
      He got her gun for her.

      The room stiffened into paralyzed immobility. Then the colors began to drain
      away. Objects diminished until, smoke-like, they flitted away into shadows.
      Darkness filmed everything as the objects in the room became weaker and weaker.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      The last stimuli are dying out, Poole realized. He squinted, trying to see.
      He made out Sarah Benton, sitting in the bed: a two-dimensional figure that
      doll-like had been propped up, there to fade and dwindle. Random gusts of
      dematerialized substance eddied about in unstable clouds; the elements,
      collected, fell apart, then collected once again. And then the last heat,
      energy and light

      reality. And at that point absolute blackness replaced everything, space without
      depth, not nocturanl but rather stiff and unyielding. And in addition he heard
      nothing.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Reaching, he tried to touch something. But he had nothing to reach with. Awareness
      of his own body had departed along with everything else in the universe. He had no
      hands, and even if he had, there would be nothing for them to feel.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      I am still right about the way the damn tape works, he said to himself, using a nonexistent
      mouth to communicate an invisible message.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Will this pass in ten minutes? he asked himself. Am I right about that, too? He
      waited... but knew intuitively that his time sense had departed with everything else.
      I can only wait, he realized. And hope it won't be long.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      To pace himself, he thought, I'll make up an encyclopedia; I'll try to list everything
      that begins with an "a." Let's see. He pondered. Apple, automobile, acksetron, atmosphere,
      Atlantic, tomato aspic, advertising — he thought on and on, categories slithering
      through his fright-haunted mind.

      All at once light flickered on.

      He lay on the couch in the living room, and mild sunlight spilled in through the
      single window. Two men bent over him, their hands full of tools. Maintenance men, he realized.
      They've been working on me.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;He's conscious," one of the technicians said. He rose stood back; Sarah Benton,
      dithering with anxiety, replaced him.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Thank God!" she said, breathing wetly in Poole's ear. &ldquo;I was so afraid; I called
      Mr. Danceman finally about —"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;What happened?" Poole broke in harshly. &ldquo;Start from the beginning and for God's
      sake speak slowly. So I can assimilate it all."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Sarah composed herself, paused to rub her nose, and then plunged on nervously,
      &ldquo;You passed out. You just lay there, as if you were dead. I waited until two-thirty
      and you did nothing. I called Mr. Danceman, waking him up unfortunately, and he called
      the electric ant maintenance — I mean, the organic-roby maintenance people, and these
      two men came about four fourty-five, and they've been working on you ever since. It's
      now six fifteen in the morning. And I'm very cold and I want to go to bed; I can't make it
      in to the office today; I really can't." She turned away, sniffling. The sound
      annoyed him.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      One of the uniformed maintenance men said, &ldquo;You've been playing around with
      your reality tape."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Yes," Poole said. Why deny it? Obviously they had found the inserted solid
      strip. &ldquo;I shouldn't have been out that long," he said. &ldquo;I inserted a ten minute
      strip only."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;It shut off the tape transport," the technician explained. &ldquo;The tape stopped
      moving forward; your insertion jammed it, and it automatically shut down to
      avoid tearing the tape. Why would you want to fiddle around with that? Don't
      you know what you could do?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I'm not sure," Poole said.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;But you have a good idea."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Poole said acridly, &ldquo;That's why I'm doing it."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Your bill," the maintenance man said, &ldquo;is going to be ninety-five frogs.
      Payable in installments, if you so desire."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Shave the tape next time," the primary technician told him. &ldquo;That way it
      won't jam. Didn't it occur to you that it had a safety factor built into it?
      So it would stop rather than —"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;What happens," Poole interupted, his voice low and intensely careful, &ldquo;if

      The technicians glanced at each other. One said, &ldquo;All the neuro circuits
      jump their gaps and short out."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Meaning what?" Poole said.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Meaning it's the end of the mechanism."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Poole said, &ldquo;I've examined the circuit. It doesn't carry enough voltage to
      do that. Metal won't fuse under such slight loads of current, even if the
      terminals are touching. We're talking about a millionth of an inch in length.
      Let's assume there are a billion possible combinations at one instant arising
      from the punch-outs on the tape. The total output isn't cumulative; the amount
      of current depends on what the battery details for that module, and it's not much.
      With all gates open and going."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Would we lie?" one of the technicians asked wearily.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Why not?" Poole said. &ldquo;Here I have an opportunity to experience everything.
      Simultaneously. To know the universe and its entirety, to be momentarily
      in contact with all reality. Something that no human can do. A symphonic
      score entering my brain outside of time, all notes, all instruments sounding
      at once. And all symphonies. Do you see?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;It'll burn you out," both technicians said, together.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I don't think so," Poole said.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Sarah said, &ldquo;Would you like a cup of coffee, Mr. Poole?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Yes," he said; he lowered his legs, pressed his cold feet against the floor,
      shuddered. He then stood up. His body ached. They had me lying all night on the
      couch, he realized. All things considered, they could have done better than that.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      At the kitchen table in the far corner of the room, Garson Poole sat sipping
      coffee across from Sarah. The technicians had long since gone.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;You're not going to try any more experiments on yourself, are you?" Sarah
      asked wistfully.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Poole grated, &ldquo;I would like to control time. To reverse it." I will cut a
      segment of tape out, he thought, and fuse it in upside down. The causal
      sequences will then flow the other way. Thereupon I will walk backward down
      the steps from the roof field, back up to my door, push a locked door open,
      walk backward to the sink, where I will get out a stack of dirty dishes. I will
      seat myself at this table before the stack, fill each dish with food produced
      from my stomach... I will then transfer the food to the refrigerator. The next
      day I will take the food out of the refrigerator, pack it in bags, carry the bags
      to a supermarket, distribute the food here and there in the store. And at last,
      at the front counter, they will pay me money for this, from their cash register.
      The food will be packed with other food in big plastic boxes, shipped out of the city
      into the hydroponic plants on the Atlantic, there to be joined back to trees and
      bushes or the bodies of dead animals or pushed deep into the ground. But what
      would all that prove? A video tape running backward... I would know no more than
      I know now, which is not enough.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      What I wnat, he realized, is ultimate and absolute reality, for one microsecond.
      After that it doesn't matter, because all will be known; nothing will be left
      to understand or see.

      I might try one other change, he said to himself. Before I try cutting the tape.
      I will prick new punch-holes in the tape and see what presently emerges. It will
      be interesting because I will not know what the holes I make mean.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Using the tip of a microtool, he punched several holes, at random, on the tape.
      As close to the scanner as he could manage... he did not want to wait.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I wonder if you'll see it," he said to Sarah. Apparently not, insofar as he could
      extrapolate. &ldquo;Something may show up," he said to her. &ldquo;I just want to warn you;
      I don't want you to be afraid."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Oh dear," Sarah said tinnily.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      He examined his wristwatch. One minute passed, then a second, and a third.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      And then —
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      In the center of the room appeared a flock of green and black ducks. They
      quacked excitedly, rose from the floor, fluttered against the ceiling in a
      dithering mass of feathers and wings and frantic in their vast urge, their
      instinct, to get away.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Ducks," Poole saaid, marveling. &ldquo;I punched a hole for a flight of wild ducks."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Now something else appeared. A park bench with an elderly, tattered man seated
      on it, reading a torn, bent newspaper. He looked up, dimly made out Poole,
      smiled briefly at him with badly made dentures, and then returned to his folded-back
      newspaper. He read on.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Do you see him?" Poole asked Sarah. &ldquo;And the ducks." At that moment the ducks
      and the park bum disappeared. Nothing remained of them. The interval of the punch-holes
      has quickly passed.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;They weren't real," Sarah said. &ldquo;Where they? So how—"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;You're not real," he told Sarah. &ldquo;You're a stimulus-factor on my reality tape.
      A punch-hole that can be glazed over. Do you also have an existence in another reality
      tape, or one in an objective reality?" He did not know; he couldn't tell. Perhaps
      Sarah did not know,  either. Perhaps she existed in a thousand reality tapes; perhaps
      on every reality tape ever manufactured. &ldquo;If I cut the tape," he said,
      &ldquo;you will be everywhere and nowhere. Like everything else in the universe. At least
      as far as I am aware of it."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Sarah faltered, &ldquo;I am real."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I want to know you completely," Poole said. &ldquo;To do that I must cut the tape.
      If I don't do it now, I'll do it some other time; it's inevitable that eventually
      I'll do it." So why wait? he asked himself. And there is always the possibility
      that Danceman has reported back to my maker, that they will be making moves to
      head me off. Because, perhaps, I'm endangering their property — myself.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;You make me wish I had gone to the office after all," Sarah said, her mouth
      turned down with dimpled gloom.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Go," Poole said.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I don't want yo leave you alone."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I'll be fine," Poole said.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;No, you're not going to be fine. You're going to unplug yourself or something,
      kill yourself because you've found you're just an electric ant and not a human
      being."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      He said, presently, &ldquo;Maybe so." Maybe it boiled down to that.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;And I can't stop you," she said.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;No." He nodded in agreement.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;But I'm going to stay," Sarah said. &ldquo;Even if I can't stop you. Because if I
      do leave and you do kill yourself, I'll always ask myself for the rest of my life
      what would have happened if I had stayed. You see?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Again he nodded.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Go ahead," Sarah said.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      He rose to his feet. &ldquo;It's not pain I'm going to feel," he told her. &ldquo;Although
      it may look like that to you. Keep in mind the fact that organic robots have
      minimal pain-circuits in them. I will be experiencing the most intense —"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Don't tell me any more," she broke in. &ldquo;Just do it if you're going to,
      or don't do it if you're not."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Clumsily — because he was frightened — he wriggled his hands into the microglove
      assembly, reached to pick up a tiny tool: a sharp cutting blade. &ldquo;I am going to
      cut a tape mounted inside my chest panel," he said, as he gazed through the
      enlarging-lens system. &ldquo;That's all." His hand shook as it lifted the cutting
      blade. In a second it can be done, he realized. All over. And — I will have time
      to fuse the cut ends of the tape back together, he realized. A half hour at
      least. If I change my mind.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      He cut the tape.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Staring at him, cowering, Sarah whispered, &ldquo;Nothing happened."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;I have thirty or forty minutes." He reseated himself at the table, having
      drawn his hands from the gloves. His voice, he noticed, shook; undoubtedly
      Sarah was aware of it, and he felt anger at himself, knowing that he had
      alarmed her. &ldquo;I'm sorry," he said, irrationally; he wanted to appologize
      to her. &ldquo;Maybe you ought to leave," he said in panic; again he stood up.
      So did she, reflexively, as if imitating him; bloated and nervous she stood
      there palpitating. &ldquo;Go away," he said thickly. &ldquo;Back to the office where you
      ought to be. Where we both ought to be." I'm going to fuse the tape-ends
      together, he told himself; the tension is too great for me to stand.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Reaching his hands toward the gloves he groped to pull them over his straining
      fingers. Peering into the enlarging screen, he saw the beam from the photoelectric
      gleam upward, pointed directly into the scanner; at the same time he saw the
      end of the tape disappearing under the scanner... he saw this, understood it;
      I'm too late, he realized. It has passed through. God, he thought, help me.
      It has begun winding at a rate greater than I calculated. So it's <em>now</em>
      that —
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      He saw apples, and cobblestones and zebras. He felt warmth, the silky texture
      of cloth; he felt the ocean lapping at him and a great wind, from the north,
      plucked at him as if to lead him somewhere. Sarah was all around him, so was
      Danceman. New York glowed in the night, and the squibs about him scuttled and
      bounced through night skies and daytime and flooding and drought. Butter relaxed
      into liquid on his tongue, and at the same time hideous odors and tastes assailed
      him: the bitter presence of poisons and lemons and blades of summer grass.
      He drowned; he fell; he lay in the arms of a woman in a vast white bed which at
      the same time dinned shrilly in his ear: the warning noise of a defective elevator
      in one of the ancient, ruined downtown hotels. I am living, I have lived, I will
      never live, he said to himself, and with his thoughts came every word, every sound;
      insects squeaked and raced, and he half sank into a complex body of homeostatic
      machinery located somewhere in Tri-Plan's labs.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      He wanted to say something to Sarah. Opening his mouth he tried to bring forth words
      — a specific string of them out of the enormous mass of them brilliantly lighting
      his mind, scorching him with their utter meaning.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      His mouth burned. He wondered why.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Frozen against the wall, Sarah Benton opened her eyes and saw the curl of smoke ascending
      from Poole's half-opened mouth. Then the roby sank down, knelt on elbows and knees,
      then slowly spread out in a broken, crumpled heap. She knew without examining it that
      it had &ldquo;died."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Poole did it to himself, she realized. And it couldn't feel pain; it said so itself.
      Or at least not very much pain; maybe a little. Anyhow, not it is over.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      I had better call Mr. Danceman and tell him what's happened, she decided. Still shaky,
      she made her away across the room to the fone; picking it up, she dialed from memory.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      It thought I was a stimulus-factor on its reality tape, she said to herself. So I thought
      I would die when it "died." How strange, she thought. Why did it imagine that? It had never
      been plugged into the real world; it had "lived" in an electronic world of its own. How bizarre.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Mr. Danceman," she said when the circuit to his office had been put through.
      &ldquo;Poole is gone. It destroyed itself right in front of my eyes. You'd better
      come over."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;So we're finally free of it."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Yes, won't it be nice?"
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Danceman said, &ldquo;I'll send a couple of men over from the shop." He saw past her,
      made out the sight of Poole lying by the kitchen table. &ldquo;You go home and rest,"
      he instructed Sarah. &ldquo;You must be worn out by all this."
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      &ldquo;Yes," she said. &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Danceman." She hung up and stood, aimlessly.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      And then she noticed something.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      My hands, she thought. She held them up. Why is it I can see through them?
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      The walls of the room, too, had become ill-defined.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Trembling, she walked back to the inert roby, stood by it, not knowing what
      to do. Through her legs the carpet showed, and then the carpet became dim, and
      she saw, through it, farther layers of disintegrating matter beyond.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      Maybe if I can fuse the tape-ends back together, she thought. But she did not
      know how. And already Poole had become vague.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      The wind of early morning blew about her. She did not feel it; she had begun, now,
      to cease to feel.
    </div>
    <div class="prose">
      The winds blew on.
    </div>
